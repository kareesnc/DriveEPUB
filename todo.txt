Major items:

- Font & font size selection: affect book area only
  Store in a cookie? In the same file as location?
  If storing with location, maybe store TOC toggle status too?

Minor items:

- Improve home page to include info and instructions for app
  Also improve error handling to detect GAPI failures (bad host, creds, etc)

- Consider whether to continue using the GAPI functions for all non-upload calls,
  or if it would be better to convert everything but auth to XHR-style requests.
  For example, could make a wrapper that only has what I am using:
    2x "get" - read book, read location data
    1x "list" - convert book id into location data id
    1x "create" - create location data when a book is loaded for the first time

- If possible, highlight the current chapter title in the TOC
  (only if this can be updated when reaching a new chapter by paging too)
